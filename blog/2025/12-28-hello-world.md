Hi! Welcome to my blog!

<!-- truncate -->

Not sure why I decided to start this whole blog thing with an exclamation mark in the title and another two in the summary of the first post, but it's there now and I couldn't think of anything better in the 2 minutes it took me to write this follow-up sentence so it's staying.

So yeah. A blog.

As of writing this post I'm at the end of the second week of my 4 week holiday, the longest I've taken in years. The brain fog is finally starting to lift after a pretty grueling year of work, and I figured it might actually be fun to do a bit of writing for the first time in a *decade* as a break from spending the majority of the last 2 weeks playing video games.

Seriously, 10 whole years. I almost can't believe it's been that long since I wrote anything longer than a DM outside of work, and typing up emails/documentation isn't exactly the most exciting bit of writing one can do.

Speaking of, as an added bonus I get to do a *tiny* bit of dev outside of work to get this blog up, something I almost never do - I barely have the energy to *enjoy* my evenings most days, let alone work on side projects. I'm more than a little jealous of people who can do that without burning out.

And look, if I'm being completely honest, the main reason I'm doing this is that I usually make a list of my top 10 games every year and for once I'd like to write up my thoughts on each of them instead of just having a list that sits in my notes app or the games channel on my Discord server or Twitter (well, Bluesky now that I've deleted my Twitter account) without any context.

So yeah, look forward to that post by the end of this year. Hopefully.

...not that I expect this to be read by anyone other than myself - I wanted to get this first post written before figuring out how to publish this site to GitHub Pages, and I'm not even planning on posting it on social media or anything.

Well, maybe I'll post the top 10 games one somewhere. We'll see.

Until then, 👋.
